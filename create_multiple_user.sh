Here's a shell script that creates a user with the specified username, sets up the home directory, allows password reset on first login, and grants sudo access:

======================================================================================
#!/bin/bash

username="b f v c d e r t y u i o p xx aa ss dd ff rr ee ww qq"

# Check if the user already exists
if id "$username" &>/dev/null; then
    echo "User '$username' already exists."
    exit 1
fi

# Create the user with specified username
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash "$username"

# Set password to be reset on first login
sudo passwd -e "$username"

# Give sudo access to the user
echo "$username ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL" | sudo tee -a /etc/sudoers

echo "User '$username' has been created with password reset on first login and sudo access."

===============================================================================================


Ensure you run this script with appropriate permissions (e.g., using sudo or as a root user) since it performs operations that require elevated privileges, like creating a user and modifying /etc/sudoers.

Replace the username variable assignment with your desired username or the name you specified: "b f v c d e r t y u i o p xx aa ss dd ff rr ee ww qq". Please note that usernames with spaces might not be the best practice; it's recommended to use alphanumeric characters, underscores, or dashes.
